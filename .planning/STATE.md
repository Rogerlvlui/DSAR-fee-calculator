# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-09-13)

**Core value:** A lawyer can defend the output by saying "the engine applied rule HK-PDPO.STAFF_TIME_REDACT_EXEMPT, version 2026.09.1, authored by X on date Y, and struck the line" — never "the model assessed the claim."
**Current focus:** Phase 01 — Schemas Freeze and Walking Skeleton

## Current Position

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- [Roadmap]: Horizontal layers, but Phase 1 carries a thin walking skeleton — Postgres two-role split, Prisma, a route per role area, one audit event — proving the layers connect before real logic lands. Explicitly throwaway-tolerant.
- [Roadmap]: Phase 1's `RulePack` freeze includes the HK flat-fee extension, so neither the engine (Phase 2) nor pack authoring (Phase 3) re-opens the schema. PROJECT.md wants the invasiveness of this change recorded.
- [Roadmap]: Phases 2–5 have zero ordering between them. PACK-09 (HK/SG authoring, legal work by the product owner) is the likely schedule long pole and starts first.
- [Roadmap]: Two hard gates — schemas freeze (before Phase 2) and engine-meets-real-packs (AC-09 golden files, opening Phase 6). Everything else is parallelisable.
- [Roadmap]: ACCESS-08 and BOUND-01/BOUND-02 start in Phase 1 as glob-driven standing obligations that every later phase inherits automatically.
- [Phase 01]: pnpm 12.4.1 crashes with SIGILL on this machine (verified environment-wide, not repo-specific); substituted pnpm 11.27.0
- [Phase 01]: Corrected researched VariableDeclarator ESLint selector shape (type annotation lives on the id Identifier, not the declarator) via TDD RED-phase fixture
- [Phase 01]: Zod-first authoring shape (z.infer derives types) and subpath exports with no barrel index.ts, both per CONTEXT.md's Claude's Discretion — Avoids a shared-file bottleneck across four plans authoring entity modules in packages/schemas, and sidesteps zod's circular-import hazard between cross-referencing schemas
- [Phase 01]: MatterFlagRule and Condition deferred to plan 01-06 alongside RulePack — Condition.field: keyof ExpenseLine | keyof Matter cannot be frozen until those two entities exist; keeps the dependency pointing one way
- [Phase 01]: D-01 reconfirmed at implementation time (all-six-now); word-boundary deny-list matching adopted to avoid a finalAmount/fin false positive

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- PACK-09 authoring is legal work, not code, and gates Phase 6's golden files. If it slips, Phase 2 must not wait on it — the engine is built against the PRD §14 fixture pack by design.
- Two product-owner decisions recorded in PROJECT.md are now load-bearing on Phase 2: aggregate-cap residue allocation (ENGINE-07) and pack-content immutability enforcement (PACK-06).
- Phases 3 and 5 both add routes to `apps/web`. Low collision risk on the Phase 1 shell, but worth sequencing the shell-level changes if both run concurrently.

### Roadmap Evolution

- Phase 3.1 inserted after Phase 3: Demo Slice - In-Memory Determination Pipeline: live determination with no database, for a stakeholder presentation ~2 weeks out. Docker unavailable on the build machine; DB needed only for persistence and AC-34, neither exercised by a demo. (URGENT)
